Replicated Datatypes

Folie 1

- the very core of a database are the datatypes
	- two examples: intreg (rd, wr(k)) and counter (rd, wr)
- we want to describe how such a datatype behaves
- we want to do that in a rigorous, exact way in order to reason about datatypes
- first, we want to look at how we could formalise the behaviour of a datatype
	- a datatype has a type, a set of operations and a value from a set Val
- we can specify a function that specifies the return value of the last operation in a sequence
- first, we look at a sequence of operations in a strongly consistent system
	- S_ctr(sigma rd) = (number of inc operations in sigma), same for the int register

Folie 2

- extending the formalism to replicated data types
- operation context
- relations explained
- vis and ar relations, V

Folie 3

- extended examples F_ctr and F_intreg
- four strategies
